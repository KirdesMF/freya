<Heading content="General terms and conditions of service" />

> These general terms and conditions are drawn up in French in their original version, which alone
> is authoritative and shall prevail over any other version translated into a foreign language.

These general terms and conditions of service set out the rights and obligations of BRAINSLATE,
translation service, SIRET number **98003476300014**, the _"Service Provider"_, on the one hand, and
any individual or legal entity wishing to benefit from its services, the _"Customer"_, on the other
hand.

<Heading as="h2" content="1 . Application of the general terms and conditions - Opposability" />

Any order placed implies the Customer's full and unreserved acceptance of these general terms and
conditions for the provision of services, to the exclusion of any other document.

No particular condition can, prevail against these general terms and conditions, except formal and
written exception appearing on the final quote.

The performance of any service by the Service Provider implies that the Customer accepts these
general terms and conditions and renounces its own general terms and conditions of purchase. In the
absence of express acceptance, any contrary condition will therefore be unenforceable against the
Service Provider, regardless of when it may have been brought to the Service Provider's attention.

The fact that the Service Provider does not at any time invoke any of these general terms and
conditions for the provision of services may not be interpreted as a waiver of the right to invoke
any of the said terms and conditions at a later date.

<Heading as="h2" content="2. Placing orders / quotes" />

Each order placed by the Customer is generally preceded by a free quotation drawn up by the Service
Provider on the basis of the documents to be translated or information provided by the Customer.

The quotation sent by the Service Provider to the Customer, by post or e-mail, shall specify in
particular:

- The number of pages or words to be translated;
- The language of the translation;
- The method used to determine the price of the translation service. The translation is invoiced
  either on a fixed-rate basis, or according to the time spent, or on the basis of the service
  provider's price list in force on the day the quotation is drawn up, in particular per source word
  (i.e. per word contained in the text to be translated) or per target word (i.e. per word contained
  in the translated text) according to the breakdown proposed by the MEMO Q TRANSLATOR PRO software
  (or any other tool agreed by mutual agreement), per line or per page.
- The delivery deadline for the translation service;
- The format of the documents to be translated (in the case of a request for a specific layout of
  the delivered document);

Any price increases that may be applied, in particular for reasons of urgency, specific terminology
research or any other request outside the scope of the usual services provided by the Service
Provider.

In order to confirm the order firmly and definitively, the Customer must return the quotation to the
Service Provider unchanged, either by post, signed and marked "approved" if the quotation is sent by
post, or by e-mail, with the Customer's consent if the quotation is sent by e-mail. If acceptance of
the quotation is not received, the Service Provider reserves the right not to proceed with the
service.

If the order is not confirmed in the manner set out above within the period indicated on the
quotation or, failing this, within 3 (three) months from the date on which the quotation is sent,
the quotation will be considered null and void.

The Service Provider reserves the right, after informing the Customer, to increase the prices of the
services and/or not to respect the delivery date indicated on the Customer's initial order
confirmation, in particular in the following cases:

- Modification or addition of supplementary documents by the Customer after the quotation has been
  drawn up by the Service Provider. In this case, the Service Provider reserves the right to adjust
  the price according to the volume of additional text to be translated;
- The absence of documents when the quotation was drawn up (if the quotation had to be drawn up
  simply on the basis of the approximate number of words and an extract of the content to be
  processed).

In the absence of the Customer's express agreement to these new delivery and/or invoicing
conditions, the Service Provider reserves the right not to proceed with the service.

Unless otherwise agreed in the quotation, all costs incurred in providing the service (travel,
express mail, etc.) shall be charged to the Customer.

Any decision to grant a discount, reduction or application of sliding-scale rates, based on a
percentage or a fixed price (per page, per line or per hour), remains at the sole discretion of the
Service Provider, and solely for the service which is the subject of the discount, reduction or
application. Any discounts or rebates that may be granted to the Customer shall under no
circumstances create a vested right for subsequent services.

In the event that the Service Provider does not send the Customer a quotation in advance, orders are
placed by a simple exchange of e-mails and translation services are invoiced in accordance with the
basic rate usually applied by the Service Provider or any other rate agreed between the Service
Provider and the Customer in the exchange of e-mails. Any validation by the Customer of the deadline
communicated by the Service Provider constitutes an order.

<Heading as="h2" content="3. Proof" />

For the purposes of proving the existence of this acceptance of quotation, the Customer agrees to
consider as equivalent to the original and as perfect proof, the electronic mail, the copy and the
computer support.

<Heading as="h2" content="4. Deposit" />

Any order exceeding 1,000 (one thousand) euros excluding VAT may be subject to a request for a
deposit, the percentage of which is specified on the quotation. In this case, performance of the
services will not start until the deposit has been received.

<Heading as="h2" content="5. Delivery period" />

Subject to the Service Provider's receipt of all the documents to be translated, the delivery
deadline given as an indication and mentioned in the quotation shall only apply if the Customer
confirms the order in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in Article 2 above within 3
(three) working days of receipt of the quotation. After this period, the delivery date may be
revised depending on the Service Provider's workload.

<Heading as="h2" content="6. Obligations of the Service Provider" />

The Service Provider shall ensure that the translation is as faithful as possible to the original
and in accordance with the practices of the profession. The Service Provider shall make every effort
to take into account and incorporate into the translation any information provided by the Customer
(glossaries, plans, drawings, abbreviations, etc.). The Service Provider accepts no responsibility
for any inconsistencies or ambiguities in the original text, as the Customer is solely responsible
for verifying the technical consistency of the final text.

<Heading as="h2" content="7. Obligations of the Customer" />

The Customer undertakes to provide the Service Provider with all the texts to be translated and all
the technical information required to understand them and, where applicable, the specific
terminology required. If the Customer fails to inform the Service Provider, the latter cannot be
held responsible for any non-conformities or missed deadlines.

The Customer has 10 (ten) working days from reception of the translated or reviewed documents to
express any disagreement with the quality of the service in writing. Once this period has elapsed,
the service shall be considered to have been performed properly and no complaint may be admitted. To
this end, the customer agrees to consider as proof of delivery any acknowledgement of receipt by
post or e-mail.

<Heading as="h2" content="8. Confidentiality" />

The Service Provider commits to respecting the confidentiality of information brought to its
attention before, during or after the performance of its services. Original documents will be
returned to the Customer upon written request.

The Service Provider shall not be held liable for any interception or misappropriation of
information during data transfer, in particular via the Internet. Consequently, it is the Customer's
responsibility to inform the Service Provider, prior to or at the time of the order, of the means of
transfer it wishes to be used in order to guarantee the confidentiality of any sensitive
information.

<Heading as="h2" content="9. Format" />

The translation is delivered by e-mail in Word format. On request, it can be delivered in hard copy
by post. Any other means of transfer or format must be expressly agreed between the parties and may
be subject to additional invoicing.

<Heading as="h2" content="10. Liability" />

The Service Provider's liability is limited solely to the amount of the invoice concerned.

Under no circumstances shall the Service Provider be held liable for claims arising from stylistic
nuances.

Please note that delivery times are given as an indication only, and failure to comply with them
will not, in principle, result in penalties for late delivery. In any event, the Service Provider
may not be held liable for any direct or indirect damage caused to the Customer or to third parties
as a result of a delay in delivery due, in particular, to force majeure or to any delivery problem.

<Heading as="h2" content="11. Corrections and proofreading" />

In case of disagreement on certain points of the service, the Service Provider reserves the right to
correct the translation in cooperation with the Customer.

If the translation is to be published, the Service Provider must receive the printed version for
proofreading.

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, any correction or proofreading will be invoiced additionally at
the current hourly rate.

<Heading as="h2" content="12. Terms of payment" />

Unless otherwise specified in the quotation, invoices are net, without discount and are payable
within 30 (thirty) days from the issue date of the invoice.

In the event of payment by cheque or bank transfer from abroad, all exchange and bank charges will
be subject either to a fixed surcharge specified on the quotation, or to full re-invoicing to the
Customer.

The translation remains the property of the translator until full payment has been received.

It should be noted, with regard to business customers only, that in the case of late payment, orders
in progress are automatically suspended until full payment has been made and the Customer is liable,
without prior formal notice being required, in accordance with article L.441-6 of the French
Commercial Code, for late payment interest calculated at the rate applied by the European Central
Bank to its most recent refinancing operation plus 10 percentage points, applied to the amount of
the invoice in question, as well as a fixed indemnity for collection costs of 40 euros.

<Heading as="h2" content="13.  Intellectual property rights" />

Before submitting a document for translation to the Service Provider, the Customer must ensure that
it has the right to do so. The Customer must therefore be the author of the original document or
have obtained prior written authorisation for translation from the document's copyright holder.

Otherwise, the Service Provider may not be held liable in any way if all or part of the documents
entrusted by the Customer infringe the intellectual property rights or any other rights of a third
party or any applicable regulations. In such a case, the Customer shall be solely liable for any
damages and financial consequences arising from its negligence alone.

Furthermore, the Customer acknowledges that the translation produced by the Service Provider
constitutes a new document, the copyright to which is held jointly by the author of the original
document and the Service Provider. Consequently, in the case of services of a literary or artistic
nature, and without prejudice to its economic rights in its work, the Service Provider reserves the
right to demand that its name be mentioned on any copy or publication of its service, in accordance
with Article L.132-11 of the French Intellectual Property Code.

<Heading as="h2" content="14. Cancellation" />

In case of cancellation of an order in progress, for whatever reason, notified in writing to the
Service Provider, the work already carried out will be invoiced to the Customer at the rate of 100%
(one hundred per cent) and the work remaining to be carried out at the rate of 50% (fifty per cent).

<Heading as="h2" content="15. Amicable settlement" />

The parties commit themselves, in the event of a dispute of any nature whatsoever and before taking
any legal action, to submit to an attempt at conciliation.

To this end, as soon as the disputed event occurs, the parties undertake to communicate via
registered letter.

The parties commit to do their utmost to ensure that this conciliation has every chance of success.
They undertake to act in good faith.

_Professionals must provide consumers with the contact details of their consumer ombudsman (name,
address and website). This information is one of the compulsory details that must appear on a
professional's website. An agreement is in progress and the information will be posted here as soon
as possible._

<Heading as="h2" content="16. Applicable law" />

These general terms and conditions are subject to French law and must be interpreted in accordance
with that law. In the absence of an amicable settlement in accordance with article 15 above, the
parties grant exclusive jurisdiction to the French courts to settle any dispute relating to the
provision of the service and these general terms and conditions.

<Heading as="h2" content="17. Acceptance of the general terms and conditions" />

The Customer acknowledges having read these general terms and conditions and accepts them without
reservation.
