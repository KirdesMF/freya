        The determination of rates depends on the level of technicality and complexity of the text,
        as well as the language combination. Translations are charged on a per-word basis (0.10 to
        0.20 euros/word), the invoice is then adjusted according to the working time and the
        required delivery deadline. Please contact us for a detailed quotation or to check the
        project's feasibility!
