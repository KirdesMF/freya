      <p>Freya PALSMA - Disabled freelance professional translator</p>

      <p class="max-w-800px mx-a">
        Born and raised in France but of Dutch origin, I learnt to translate while learning to
        speak; French at school, Dutch at home. I then had the opportunity to learn English fluently
        by spending a year of my schooling in England and by pursuing this learning in the
        international section at college until I obtained the International French Baccalaureate
        (OIB/BFI) in high school. Since then, I've been able to practise and improve these languages
        professionally in the workplace; I worked for three years in the catering industry and two
        years for an international logistics provider, having daily contact with BeNeLux
        collaborators and customers.
      </p>

      <p class="max-w-800px mx-a">
        Having been diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder in adulthood, the lack of
        information and research available in French on this disease led me to discover that having
        access to translation not only enables communication between two linguistic communities or
        international trade, but above all facilitates information sharing and the enrichment of
        individual culture. Translating has become a reflex for me, and being able to offer you this
        service today means a great deal of satisfaction.
