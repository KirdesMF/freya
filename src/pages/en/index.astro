        About the translator
      </h2>

      <p>Freya PALSMA - Professional freelance translator with a disability (TIH)</p>

      <p class="max-w-800px mx-a">
        Born and educated in France but of Dutch origin, I learned to translate by learning to
        speak; French at school, Dutch at home. I then had the opportunity to learn English fluently
        by spending a year of my schooling in England and continuing this learning in the
        international section at college until obtaining the Baccalaur√©at (OIB/BFI) in an
        international high school in France. I have since been able to practice and enrich these
        languages professionally in business; I worked for three years in the hotel industry and two
        years for an international logistics provider, with daily contact with colleagues and
        clients from the BeNeLux.
      </p>

      <p class="max-w-800px mx-a">
        Having declared a rare neurological disease in adulthood, the lack of information and
        research available in French on this pathology made me discover that having access to
        translation not only allows communication between two linguistic communities or
        international trade, but above all facilitates the sharing of information and the enrichment
        of one's individual culture. <br /> Translating has become a reflex for me, and being able
        to offer you this service today is a great satisfaction.
